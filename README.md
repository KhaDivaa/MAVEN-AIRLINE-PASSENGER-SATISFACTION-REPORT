# ABOUT DATASET
The dataset contains a single CSV file with 129,880 Airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight and type of travel as well as their evaluation of different factors and overall experience which makes up 24 fields.

# MY APPROACH
Firstly, I imported the dataset into Microsoft Excel to view the data and better understand the various fields that makes up the columns.

# DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
I uploaded the data into power query where I checked for empty and null values and duplicates. I then grouped the ages of the passengers into 4: children, youths, adults and old citizens and I also grouped the flight length into: short haul, medium haul and long haul.

# ANALYSIS
* The dataset contains 129,880 respondents, 51% of which are female and 49% male. Also, majority of the respondents are adults within the age of 26-65.

* The airline has more returning customers than first-time customers and majority of them travel short distances.

# CUSTOMERS RATING
* According to the analysis carried out on the customers ratings based on the airline services, it can be concluded that majority of the respondents are very satisfied with the in-flight services, baggage handling and the seat comfort.

*  On the other hand,in flight WiFi service, ease of online booking and gate location got more negative ratings from the respondents.

# DATA VISUALIZATION

* I utilized different charts on PowerBI and created an interactive, insightful and aesthetically pleasing dashboard to better display my insights and simplify the analysis.

# RECOMMENDATIONS 

* Respondents were quite displeased with the economic class so facilities should be improved to ensure that the passengers get the value for their money and in turn, satisfactory feedback.
* The airline should provide a wifi device with significant improvement in speed and bandwidth for better customer experience and satisfaction.
* Online booking should be made more accessible for customer and the airline website should be easy to navigate to encourage the use of the website for flight bookings.
* The Gate should be made easily accessible and convenient for arriving and departing passengers. Also, maps can be pasted in strategic places to direct first-time customers for a stress-free experience.
* Departure and Arrival Time should be on schedule and timely.
